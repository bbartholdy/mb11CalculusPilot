  Dental calculus is an excellent source of information on the dietary patterns
  of past populations, including consumption of plant-based items. The detection
  of plant-derived residues such as alkaloids and their metabolites in dental
  calculus provides direct evidence of consumption by individuals within a
  population.
  We conducted a study on 41 individuals from Middenbeemster, a 19th century rural
  Dutch archaeological site. Skeletal and dental analysis was performed to explore
  potential relationships between pathological lesions and presence of alkaloids.
  Dental calculus
  was analysed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem
  mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS).
  We were able to detect nicotine, cotinine, caffeine, theophylline, and salicylic
  acid, suggesting the consumption of tea and
  coffee and smoking of tobacco on an individual scale, which is also confirmed
  by historic documentation and identification of pipe notches in the dentition.
  Nicotine and/or cotinine was present in 56% of individuals with at least one
  visible pipe notch.
  There is some influence of skeletal preservation on the detection
  of alkaloids, with higher quantities of compounds extracted
  from well-preserved individuals, and we observe a positive relationship between
  weight of the calculus sample and quantity of detected compounds, as well as
  between chronic maxillary sinusitis and the presence of multiple alkaloids.
  There are many limitations that will need to be addressed going
  forward with this type of analysis; we stress the need for more systematic
  research on the consumption of alkaloid-containing items and their subsequent
  concentration and preservation in dental calculus, in addition to how mode of
  consumption may affect concentrations in the dentition.
  Despite the limitations, this preliminary study illustrates many benefits
  of using calculus to target a variety of compounds that could have been consumed
  as medicine or diet. This method allows us
  to directly address specific individuals, which can be especially useful in
  individuals that are not always well-documented in historic documentation,
  such as rural populations, and especially children and women.
