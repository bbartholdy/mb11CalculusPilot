## How to run in your browser or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical programming
language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R software](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
itself, optionally (but recommended) [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/). 

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL:
[main.zip](/archive/main.zip). After unzipping:
- open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio
- run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the
[DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file).
- finally, open `analysis/paper/paper.qmd` and **render** to produce the PDF manuscript (`_output/`),
  or run `rmarkdown::render("analysis/paper/paper.qmd")` in the R console.
