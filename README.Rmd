## How to run in your browser or download and run locally

**If you are running Linux, you will need to install the following dependencies:**

- libblas-dev liblapack-dev gfortran

e.g. `sudo apt install libblas-dev liblapack-dev gfortran` for Ubuntu.

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical programming
language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R software](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
itself, optionally (but recommended) [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/). 

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL:

[main.zip](/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

or clone the repository:

`git clone git@github.com:bbartholdy/mb11CalculusPilot.git`

Then:

- open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio
- run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the
[DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file).
- finally, open `analysis/paper/paper.qmd` and **render** to produce the PDF manuscript (`_output/`),
  or run `quarto::quarto_render("analysis/paper/paper.qmd")` in the R console.
